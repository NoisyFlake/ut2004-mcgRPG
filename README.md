# mcgRPG 1.9.9.1 for UT2004

Source extracted from mcgRPG1_9_9_1.u with `ucc batchexport`.

I doubt that anyone ever needs this in 2022, but maybe someone else remembered this mutator and wants to play with it.

Also [fixed a bug](https://github.com/NoisyFlake/ut2004-mcgRPG/blob/06202d65615348f27df0a395a39ed707cf4892c7/Classes/DruidLoaded.uc#L83-L84) that made it impossible to buy the Loaded Weapons ability before Level 500.
